Let me explain how quantum key distribution (QKD) works - this is the foundation of quantum-secured communications. I'll create a simple simulation to demonstrate the BB84 protocol, which is the most well-known QKD protocol.

This simulation demonstrates the fundamentals of quantum key distribution using the BB84 protocol. Here's how it works:

1. Alice (sender) creates qubits in random quantum states using two different bases (rectilinear and diagonal)
2. Bob (receiver) measures these qubits using randomly chosen bases
3. They publicly compare which bases they used but not the actual measurements
4. They keep only the bits where they used the same basis, creating a shared secret key

Key security features:
- Any eavesdropping attempt will disturb the quantum states due to the no-cloning theorem
- The security is based on fundamental physics, not mathematical complexity
- The final key can be used with conventional symmetric encryption

This is a simplified simulation - real quantum cryptography requires:
- Actual quantum hardware (single photon sources, detectors)
- Quantum channels (usually fiber optic)
- Error correction and privacy amplification

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the protocol in more detail?
